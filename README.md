# Python Implementation of Common Data Structures and Algorithms
## Introduction
Data structure and algorithm are so fundamental to everyday programming that I believe it is a "must-learn" for all serious programmers.<br>
I have taken a few courses from my undergraduate education and Coursera, but I too frequently forget the important concepts of these structures and algorithms. Finally, I decided to implement them myself to get a firmer grasp of them.<br>
Most of them are realisation of the concepts I learnt from [Princeton Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Stanford Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera. These are two really awesome courses that I do not hesitate to recommend to other programmers.

## Installation
To avoid the convoluted path system in python, I chose to write them as an installable package. If you are playing around with these codes, you need to install the `algo` package as below.
```bash
# cd to this parent directory
pip install -e .
```
It will install a package called `algo` in your environment. All the classes and functions from the algo folder can then be accessed anywhere.
